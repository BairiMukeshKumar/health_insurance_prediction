Health insurance prediction involves using data and technology to make informed guesses about various aspects of health insurance, such as who is likely to buy insurance, how much they might claim, and who may be at higher risk of needing medical care. By analyzing information like age, health history, and lifestyle habits, computer models can identify patterns and predict outcomes. These predictions help insurance companies offer personalized plans, set fair prices, detect fraud, and manage risks more effectively, improving services for customers while optimizing resources.
